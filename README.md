# -Event-Based-Facial-Expression-Recognition
A compact event-based facial expression recognition pipeline that merges neuromorphic (Nefer) and video (CK+) data, converts them into voxelized event streams via V2E, and uses a ResNet-50 backbone with an LSTM head to capture spatial and temporal featuresâ€”achieving around 85 % accuracy across six emotion classes.
